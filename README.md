# Work-Hours-Analysis

[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)  

This is a program one can use to monitor the hours put into work on daily and weekly basis. The project was created because of the personal need to track hours each day that are put into work and those which are wasted.  

The hours put into work each day can decide the future of an individual, and hence maximizing the work hours and minimizing the hours wasted on things that are not necessary is really important in order to improve productivity.
